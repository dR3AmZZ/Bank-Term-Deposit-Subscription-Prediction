# Bank-Term-Deposit-Subscription-Prediction
Using telemarketing dataset generated from a Portuguese banking institution, I used multiple machine learning methods (Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest) to analyze consumers demographic influence on telemarking calls for selling bank long-term deposits. In this project, I performed and compared three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest . Model evaluation process will be conducted by measuring the Area Under the Curve (AUC), to testify the ability of a classifier to capture the degree of variance between classes. The entire project has demonstrated the validation of using machine learning models to anticipate and predict consumersâ€™ loyalty for telemarketing campaign.
